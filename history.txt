History / release notes for Software Construction Toolkit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.0           2009-02-27

  Changes:

    * Disabled code coverage tests under code coverage on Windows and Linux.
    * Added tests:
          component_targets_msvc_test.py
          component_targets_xml_test.py
          distcc_test.py
          runtest_test.py
          sdl_test.py
          visual_studio_solution_test.py
    * Removed unused exists() function from tools.  SCons only calls exists()
      to detect its own built-in tools, so these aren't needed.
    * Added workaround for naclsdk and sdl tools crashing if their local tools
      weren't installed.  These checks can now be diabled via $SDL_MODE and
      $NACL_SDK_VALIDATE variables, so these tools can be tested.
    * Fixed ComponentVSSourceProjectBuilder() not picking up sources from
      inside $MAIN_DIR, though it worked for sources with absolute paths.

  Issues fixed:

    1: mandelbrot sample doesn’t work if the current directory has spaces
    2: hammer.bat does not properly escape spaces in current directory
